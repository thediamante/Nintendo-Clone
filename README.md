<h1>Nintendo Clone Website</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was made from scratch to imitate the official Nintendo website homepage based on visuals including hover effects as much as possible. This showcases my early web development skills using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. All links (&lt;a&gt; tag) within the project goes directly to the official website pages.
